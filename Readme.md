## What is this?
This project's purpose was to find out how you can create realistic shadow effects on the example of the simple mug. I really wanted to figure out whether is it possible to do something like that, and in the process of doing it accidentally slapped an owl sticker on the mug. Well, that's how it goes over here, owl obsession on the rise ðŸ˜‰
You can play around and experiment with it [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/rjVqMG) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
